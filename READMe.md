# Test with Unity

This was my inital venture into the world of programming.  After watching hours of tutorials online I ended up with a simple prototype of a platformer. 

While I'm certainly proud of what has come out of this, I wrote the code for this years ago, and hardly remember much about C# anymore.  

## Demo

This is a short demo showcasing what I was able to achieve.  It includes fluid player movement, with the ability to walljump.  I made several different variations of platforms.  Standard platforms, platforms that blink on a cycle, platforms that disappear when there is a collision with the player, moving platforms, and platforms that disappear after a collision with the player then reappear after a set amount of time.

## Version 
This was originally written with unity 4.  Most of the API from 4 was depricated after the upgrade to unity 2017. 
It currently uses Unity 2017.4
